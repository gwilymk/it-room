= IT Room

IT room is an application for Llanfyllin-High School which allows the
teachers there to book IT rooms easily and quickly. The application
is made with Ruby on Rails, the agile web development toolkit. It
uses a database for all the information storage so is quick.

== Translations

The whole application was designed to be translatable, so most of the
user interface can and is translated into Welsh. The system can
handle many users at a time.

A new translation and current ones can be changed by editing the
values in config/locales and creating a new file there with the
2 character language code. Also, you will need to edit the file
in config called application.rb. At the bottom, add your language
to the LANGUAGES hash.

== The defualts

Upon startup, the default user is "root" with the password "root1234".
It is advised that you create a new root user and delete the original
as this is more secure. It is more secure because then a hacker must
guess the username of the root account and then the password as well
instead of just the password.
